   - Overview of Nest.js, an efficient Node.js framework for building scalable server-side applications.
     <br />

2. **Modules and Structuring** 📁

   - Organizing Nest.js applications into modules, improving modularity and code reuse.
     <br />

3. **Controllers** 📲

   - Implementing controllers to handle requests and send appropriate responses.
     <br />

4. **Services** 🔧

   - Creating services to encapsulate business logic and promote dependency injection.
     <br />

5. **Database with TypeORM** 🗄️

   - Integration with TypeORM to simplify database manipulation, supporting relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.
     <br />

6. **Pipes and Validations** 🔍

   - Using Pipes to automatically transform and validate request data.
     <br />

7. **Guards and Authentication** 🔒

   - Creating Guards to protect routes and implementing authentication strategies using JWT and Passport.
     <br />

8. **Middleware and Interceptors** 🔌

   - Using middleware and interceptors to intercept requests, responses, and add additional logic.

## Available Resources 📚

In this repository, you will find:

- Practical exercises: Exercises proposed for students to practice the learned concepts.
- Code examples: Source code examples to illustrate the topics covered in the classes.
- Other resources: Useful links, references to books, articles, and complementary materials to deepen your knowledge.

## How this repository works 🗂️📚

To better organize the files, each week of class has its own **branch** with the corresponding files.

### How to switch branches 🔄

Follow the steps below to switch branches and access the files for the desired week:

1. **Check available branches** 📝:

   ```bash
   git branch -r
   ```

   This command lists all available remote branches.

2. **Switch to the week's branch** 📅:

   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   ```

   Replace `branch-name` with the branch corresponding to the week you want to access, such as `feat/week-one`, `feat/week-two`, etc.

3. **Update the branch** 🔄:
   If you need to update the branch to the latest version, use:
   ```bash
   git pull origin branch-name
   ```

### Example 👇

```bash
git checkout feat/week-one
```

Now you will have access to the files for week 1!

#### Tip 💡

Don't forget to always save your changes before switching branches, using `git commit` or `git stash` to avoid losing your progress.
